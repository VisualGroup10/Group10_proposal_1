## 4.1  Available Jobs by location
We establish (geographically) the number of jobs available and building type (commercial, residential, school) to see where the job opportunities are and potential 'deadzones' without jobs or people nearby.

User can toggle the company locations by the number of available jobs in the "Number of Available Jobs" drop down. This can be overlaid with the types of buildings (Commercial, Residential and School).

```{r fig.dim = c(8, 6), echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("image/jobs_buildings_map.png")
```

## 4.2 Joviality vs total income
Does money equal happiness?
We establish a dot plot of individual participants happiness against wages. The end user can filter these data points by "Presence of kids" in the drop down view the results by education level by hovering over the dots. These can be used to identify potential areas of churn to be improved on for employers and potential policies to improve attractiveness of jobs.
